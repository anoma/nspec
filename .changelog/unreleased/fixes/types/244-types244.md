  -  [**#244**](https://github.com/anoma/nspec/pull/244): `Engine` - add `cfg`
     field of type `EngineConfig` with the static configuration for the engine
     that includes the `EngineName` and local `NodeID`, remove `name` field
     since it's already part of `EngineConfig`. `EngineEnv` - rename from
     `EngineEnvironment`. `EngineBehaviour` - remove conflict solver, this will
     be taken care of by a different mechanism to be defined by #246, remove
     precomputation results, as these are passed as args to the actions instead,
     remove `action` field of `EngineBehaviour`, instead the list of actions are
     defined by the action label type as an argument to the label, further
     improvements to this mechanism to be defined by #246.
