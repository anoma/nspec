- [**#244**](https://github.com/anoma/nspec/pull/244): Major refactoring of
  engine-related types. The `Engine` type now includes a `cfg` field of type
  `EngineConfig` containing static configuration (engine name and local node
  ID). For consistency, `EngineEnvironment` has been renamed to `EngineEnv`. The
  `EngineBehaviour` type has undergone several changes: the conflict solver has
  been removed (to be replaced by new mechanism in
  [#246](https://github.com/anoma/nspec/pull/246)), precomputation results are
  now passed directly as action arguments, and the `action` field has been
  replaced with action labels defined by label type.
