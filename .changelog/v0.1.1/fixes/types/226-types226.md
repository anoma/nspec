  -  [**#226**](https://github.com/anoma/nspec/pull/226): Update [[Template Engine|Template]] & [[Ticker Behaviour|Ticker Behaviour]] according to the engine & message type changes. The examples have been improved with better clarity. The documentation now uses headlines instead of collapsible boxes and definition lists instead of tables. A new diagram template has been added that illustrates conditions and effects of actions.
