  -  [**#217**](https://github.com/anoma/nspec/pull/217): Update template engine
     files to be more consistent, use backticks for Juvix terms/types in
     headlines, uncollapsed sections for type constructors arguments in template
     engine files, and auxiliary sections of Juvix code are always collapsed.
