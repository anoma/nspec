# Protocol Architecture

This section describes the architecture of the protocol. The architecture is split into two sub-sections:

- [Architecture 1](./architecture-1.md) describes the structure of the distributed network, distributed state, important types, and properties.
- [Architecture 2](./architecture-2.md) describes how a node is internally composed of various engines and how precisely each engine works.
