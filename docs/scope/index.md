# Scope

This section describes the _scope_ of Anoma.

The scope defines:

- the model and bounds of the problem the protocol attempts to solve
- the high-level type that the protocol must instantiate
- requirements that the protocol must satisfy

The scope section is split into two sub-sections:

- [World model](./world_model.md) describes the world context in which the
  protocol is designed to operate.
- [Protocol desiderata](./protocol_desiderata.md) describes what it is
  that the protocol must do.

In Section ["Protocol Architecture"](./../architecture/index.md), we
describes a protocol which instantiates this type and satisfies these
requirements.

    Figure out if this instantiation is in a meaningful sense "without loss of generality", and note this.
