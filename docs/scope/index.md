# Scope

This section describes the _scope_ of Anoma.

The scope defines:

- the model and bounds of the problem the protocol attempts to solve
- the high-level type that the protocol must instantiate
- requirements that the protocol must satisfy

The scope section is split into two sub-sections:

- [World model](./world-model.md) describes the world context in which the
  protocol is designed to operate.
- [Protocol desiderata](./protocol-desiderata.md) describes what it is
  that the protocol must do.

In the remainder of this specification document, we
describe a protocol which instantiates this type and satisfies these
requirements.
