# Scope

This section describes the _scope_ of Anoma.

The scope defines the basic conceptual model on the basis of which the protocol operates and the high-level functionality which the protocol aims to provide.

The scope section is split into two sub-sections:

- [World model](./world-model.md) describes the basic conceptual model on the basis of which the protocol operates.
- [Protocol desiderata](./protocol-desiderata.md) describes the high-level functionality which the protocol aims to provide.
