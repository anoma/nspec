# Resource Machine

The Anoma Resource Machine is a key component of the Anoma protocol, responsible
for managing state updates based on user preferences.

## Abstract

The article explores the Anoma Resource Machine (ARM) within the Anoma protocol, providing a comprehensive understanding of its role in facilitating state updates based on user preferences. Drawing parallels with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, the ARM introduces a flexible transaction model, diverging from traditional account and UTXO models. Key properties such as atomic state transitions, information flow control, account abstraction, and an intent-centric architecture contribute to the ARM's robustness and versatility. Inspired by the Zcash protocol, the ARM leverages commitment accumulators to ensure transaction privacy. The article outlines essential building blocks, computable components, and requirements for constructing the ARM, highlighting its unique approach to resource-based state management....
