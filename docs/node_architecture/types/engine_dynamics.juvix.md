??? info "Juvix imports"

    ```juvix
    module node_architecture.types.engine_dynamics;
    import node_architecture.basics open;
    import node_architecture.types.anoma_message as Anoma;
    import node_architecture.types.engine_environment open;
    import node_architecture.types.anoma_environment as Anoma;
    ```

# Engine dynamics

Each engine processes only one message at a time. The behaviour of an engine is
specified by a finite set of _guards_ and an _action function,_ which determine
how engine react to received messages or timer notifications.

## Guards

Guards are terms of type `Guard`, which is a function type

```
-- --8<-- "./docs/node_architecture/types/engine_dynamics.juvix.md!:guard-type"
```

where the _trigger_ of type `TimestampedTrigger I H` is a term that captures the
message received with a timestamp. This trigger can include the received
message or timers that have elapsed during the engine's operation. Guards return
data of type `GuardOutput A L X` if the condition is met.

Recall that the behaviour is described by a set of guards and an action
function. The guard is a function that evaluates conditions in the engine
environment to determine whether an action should be performed.

The guard function receives, not in any particular order:

- the timestamped trigger that caused it to be evaluated,
- the environment of the engine instance, and
- an optional time reference for the starting point of the evaluation of all guards.

Given these inputs, the guard function determines if the condition for running
the action(s) it is guarding are met. The action function can compute the
effects of actionsâ€”not only changes to the engine environment, but also which
messages will be sent, what engines will be created, and how the list of timers
is updated.


## Action function

The input is parameterised by the types for: local state, incoming messages,
mailboxes' state, the output of guard functions, timer's handles, matched
arguments, action labels, and precomputation result. The types of the input and
output of an action are:

- `ActionInput S I M H A L X` and
- `ActionEffect S I M H A L X`.

The `ActionInput S I M H A L X ` type is a record that encapsulates the following data:

- A term of type `GuardOutput A L X`, which represents
  - the matched arguments, e.g., from a received message,
  - the action label that determines the action to be performed
  - other (expensive) precomputation results that
    the guard function has already calculated.
- The environment of the corresponding engine instance.
- The local time of the engine instance when guard evaluation was triggered.

```juvix
type GuardOutput (A L X : Type) := mkGuardOutput{
     args : List A;
     label : L;
     other : X
};
```


```juvix 
{-# isabelle-ignore: true #-} -- TODO: remove this when the compiler is fixed
Guard (I H S M A L X : Type) : Type :=
  -- --8<-- [start: guard-type]
  TimestampedTrigger I H -> EngineEnvironment S I M H -> Maybe (GuardOutput A L X);
  -- --8<-- [end: guard-type]
```

### Action input


```juvix
type ActionInput (S I M H A L X : Type)
  := mkActionInput {
      guardOutput : GuardOutput A L X;
      env : EngineEnvironment S I M H;
      trigger : TimestampedTrigger I H;
};
```

### Action effect

The `ActionEffect S I M H A L X` type defines the results produced by the
action, which can be

- Update its environment (while leaving the name unchanged).
- Produce a set of messages to be sent to other engine instances.
- Set, discards, or supersede timers.
- Define new engine instances to be created.4

```juvix
type ActionEffect (S I M H A L X : Type) := mkActionEffect {
    newEnv : EngineEnvironment S I M H;
    producedMessages : List (EnvelopedMessage Anoma.Msg);
    timers : List (Timer H);
    spawnedEngines : List Anoma.Env;
};
```


```juvix
{-# isabelle-ignore: true #-} -- TODO: remove this when the compiler is fixed
ActionFunction (S I M H A L X : Type) : Type :=  ActionInput S I M H A L X -> ActionEffect S I M H A L X;
```

??? info "On creating new engine instances"

    To create new engine instances, we need to specify the following data:

    - A unique name for the new engine instance.
    - The initial state of the engine instance.
    - The corresponding set of guards and the action function.

    The last point is however implicit.


If the guard does not give a result, this means that none of its guarded actions
are triggered.

??? info "On the type signature of the guard function"

    In principle, borrowing terminology from Hoare logic, a guard is a
    _precondition_ to run an action. The corresponding predicate is activated by a
    trigger and evaluated within the context of the engine's environment. It then
    returns a boolean when the predicate is satisfied, specifically of type

    ```haskell
    Trigger I H -> EngineEnvironment S I M H -> Bool;
    ```

    However, as a design choice, guards will return additional data of type `GuardOutput A L X` that
    may or may not use the engine environment if the condition is met. Thus, if
    the guard is satisfied, this data (of type `GuardOutput A L X`) is assumed to be passed to the
    action function. Then, if the guard is not satisfied, no data is
    returned.

#### Conflict resolution

Finally, `resolveConflict` is a function that takes a finite set of action
labels as input; it outputs a list of action label sets that are pairwise
disjoint and whose union is the input set or is empty, if conflict resolution
fails. And for each element of the output it should be that if applied to this
element, it returns the one element list of the set itself.

```
conflictSolver : Set A -> List (Set A);
```
