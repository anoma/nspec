# Decryption Engine

A decryption engine instance is responsible for decrypting data encrypted to a particular identity. Decryption engine instances are generated by calling the identity management engine to generate or connect an identity. Once a decryption engine instance has been generated, only the original caller and anyone to whom they pass the engine instance reference can send messages to the instance (and decrypt data encrypted to the corresponding identity). Additional callers may make additional connection requests, which the backend may accept or deny depending on what its policies are (for example, allowing only one connection, allowing only specific engine identifiers/types to connect, etc.)
