# Commitment Engine

A commitment engine instance is responsible for generating commitments by a particular identity. Commitment engine instances are generated by calling the identity management engine to generate or connect an identity. Once a commitment engine instance has been generated, only the original caller and anyone to whom they pass the engine instance reference can send messages to the instance (and generate commitments by the corresponding identity).

## Messages
