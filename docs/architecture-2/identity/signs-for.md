# Signs For Engine

The Signs For Engine tracks signs-for relationships between identities as described in [SignsFor Relation](../../architecture-1/abstractions/identity.md#signsfor-relation). It supports querying which identities sign for another identity or can be signed for by it, submitting evidence that one identity signs for another, and querying evidence concerning known signs-for relationships.
