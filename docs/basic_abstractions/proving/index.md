# Proving

What exactly is a _proof_? If a proof - operationally - is simply whatever is necessary to convince a particular party to believe that a statement is true, then in a heterogeneous trust system such as Anoma, there can be no single definition of what a proof must include, as different parties will be willing to make different assumptions and will thus accept different proofs. Rather, the protocol standardizes a type of _assumptions_, such that parties can specify which assumptions they are willing to make, and a multiformat for _proofs_, where each proof must describe what assumptions are required in order to consider it valid.
