# Basic Abstractions

This section describes the basic abstractions used throughout the protocol specification. Basic abstractions are grouped into two areas of concern: encooding, covering how data and code are represented, evaluated, and converted between representations, and cryptographic primitives, covering the basic cryptographic primitives used throughout the protocol.

    Note for authors: this section should be complete - all abstractions used across the protocol and required for agreement between nodes should be defined here.
