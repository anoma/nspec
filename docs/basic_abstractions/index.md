# Basic Abstractions

This section describes the basic abstractions used throughout the protocol specification.

Following [[Preliminaries|preliminaries]], basic abstractions are grouped into three areas of concern:

- encooding, covering how data and code are represented, evaluated, and converted between representations
- proving, covering how proofs are made and verified, what assumptions are required, and how these are tracked
- cryptographic primitives, covering the basic cryptographic primitives used throughout the protocol

    Note for authors: this section should be complete - all abstractions used across the protocol and required for agreement between nodes should be defined here.
