# Headers and other Markdown conventions

- Use semantic headers to structure your content.

  - Use `#` for the main title, `##` for the first-level header, `###` for the
    second-level header.
  - Only use up to the third level of headers. If you need more levels, consider
    restructuring your content.

- Use sentence case for headers. For example,

  - use "How to use this Glossary" instead of "How to Use This Glossary", or,
  - use "Anoma protocol" instead of  "Anoma Protocol", or
  - use "On engine systems for the Anoma Specification" instead of "On Engine
    Systems For The Anoma Specification".

- Always add a front matter as described in [[Write using Markdown plus Anoma extensions#front-matter|Write using Markdown]].

- The (Juvix) Markdown filenames should follow the convention as described in [[File naming conventions]].
