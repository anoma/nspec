# Snake Case Convention for Naming Files and Folders

## Guidelines:

- Start with a lowercase letter.
- Separate words with underscores `_`.
- Avoid using special characters or spaces.

## Pros:

- Readability: Improves readability by clearly separating words in names, making
  code more understandable.
- Consistency: Creates a uniform naming style throughout the codebase.
- Compatibility: Widely supported across different programming languages and
  platforms, no issues with case sensitivity.

## Cons:

- Length: Can make names longer.
- Visual Clutter: The underscores can create visual clutter, especially in
  longer names. We suffer from this, specially in engine's description files.
