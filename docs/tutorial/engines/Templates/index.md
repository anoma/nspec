# Engine Family Templates

For each engine template, 
we have three different files
and accordingly, we have three different template files:

1. [[Engine Overview]]
2. [[Engine Environment]]
3. [[Engine Dynamics]]

In the template files, 
we shall use text in square brackets to describe generic content.
For example,
`[Engine Family Name]` is a placeholde for the name of 
an engine family that is to be described.
Occasionally,
we use angled parentheses and italics
for variables _⟨[variableName]⟩,_
e.g, _⟨hash⟩_ is a variable for hashes.
