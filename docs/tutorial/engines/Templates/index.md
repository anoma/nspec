# Engine Family Templates

For each engine template, 
we have three different files
and accordingly, we have three different template files,
each of which comes with an example file, which can be opened side by side.

1. [[Engine Overview]] ([[Engine Overview Example]])
2. [[Engine Environment]] ([[Engine Environment Example]])
3. [[Engine Dynamics]] ([[Engine Dynamics Example]])

In the template files, 
we shall use text in square brackets to describe generic content.
For example,
`[Engine Family Name]` is a placeholde for the name of 
an engine family that is to be described.
Occasionally,
we use angled parentheses and italics
for variables _⟨[variableName]⟩,_
e.g, _⟨hash⟩_ is a variable for hashes.
