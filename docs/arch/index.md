# Protocol Architecture

This section describes the architecture of the protocol. The architecture is
split into two subsections:

- [[System Architecture]] describes the structure of the
  distributed network, distributed state, important types, and properties.

- [[Node Architecture]] describes how a node is internally
  composed of various engines and how precisely each engine works.
