# Protocol Architecture

This section describes the architecture of the protocol. The architecture is
split into two subsections:

<!--ᚦ
    «Would it make sense to switch the order of the two sections?»
-->

- [[System Architecture]] describes the structure of the
  distributed network, distributed state, important types, and properties.


!!! todo "overview"

    - Function definitions
    - Type definitions
    - What else?


- [[Node Architecture]] describes how a node is internally
  composed of various engines and how precisely each engine works.

!!! todo "overview"

    - Complete list of different _types_ of engines within each node
    - How do engine instances on a node communicate with other engines on other nodes
    - what else


<!--ᚦ
    «BTW, do we want and index.md or index.juvix.md for every file?»
-->
