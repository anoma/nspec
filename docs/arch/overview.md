# Anoma architecture

The Anoma architecture is the blueprint that defines the structure and behaviour
of the components that make up the Anoma protocol. There is one high-level
component: the System architecture[^1].

## System architecture

Defines the high-level structure and behaviour of the distributed network,
including:

- Distributed state management <!-- and consensus -->
- Core data types and data flow for Network operations
- System-wide properties and guarantees

[^1]: The Node architecture is a work-in-progress and can be found in the [v0.2.0](https://specs.anoma.net/v0.2.0/) release.
