# Introduction
â€‹
The operational architecture specification concerns the state evolution of Anoma instances, broken into smaller steps: which messages are exchanged, how computation is performed on the level of function calls, and which intermediate states are reachable.
The specification is organized into the following sections:

- [[Hardware Machine]]

- [[Identity Machine]]

- [[Networking Machine]]

- [[Ordering Machine]]
