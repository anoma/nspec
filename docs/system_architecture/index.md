# Introduction

We first describe on the highest level of abstraction what it means to be a
correct implementation of Anoma and how it is structured. This already involves
some design choices and assumptions, like identifying the participating
entities, their actions, and the hardware needed.

- Host model describes the basic characteristics and functions which
  machines must have in order to run Anoma.
- Primitives describe the basic cryptographic primitives and associated
  assumptions.
- [[Abstractions]] describes the basic abstractions defined by the protocol.
- [[Properties]] describes the properties that the protocol
  should satisfy.
