# Computable components

Resource computable components are the components that are not a resource component but can be derived from the resource components, other computable components, and possibly some extra data.

Resources have four computable components:

- `r.commitment()`
- `r.nullifier(nullifierKey)`
- `r.kind()`
- `r.delta()`
