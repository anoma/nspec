# Anoma Protocol Specification

!!! info inline end "Anoma entities"

    The term "**Anoma**" as used on this site refers specifically to the **Anoma Protocol**. However, it may
    also be used elsewhere to refer to related entities such as the **Anoma
    Network** or the **Anoma Foundation**.

    - The **Anoma Network**, a network of nodes using the Anoma protocol.

    - The **Anoma Foundation**, a Swiss foundation (Stiftung) established to support and coordinate the
    Anoma protocol, network, and the surrounding ecosystem.

**Anoma** is a distributed operating system for *intent-centric*
applications[@goes2024anoma]. The **Anoma protocol architecture**, object of
this specification, supports interoperability at state, network, and application
levels without restricting the types of intents or computational methods used to
solve them.

As a multi-party intent-centric architecture, Anoma is designed for applications
concerned with:

- Coordination of socio-economic processes dealing with resources,
- distributed capabilities (freedom of action, and control over resources), and
- agreement between agents (users) under conditions of heterogeneous trust.

The same architecture supports both arbitrary *fungible* measures of value (e.g.
currencies) and unique (*non-fungible*) objects, so users can choose the
representations and level of precision most appropriate to model aspects of the
world which they care about.
